• .bat and PS scripts for automatically organizing files from desktop into main subfolders in Windows [Documents, Music, Photos, Videos]
• execution policy privileges usually make powershell script a hastle to run, unless you right click and state "Run in powershell", however this is more of a run once solution on simple desktops
• running .bat out of scheduled tasks is the intended use for these scripts [or PS1 if execution policy allows]
• Documents, Music and Video organizer lines are commented out by default
• Other lines can be added if you use other filetypes more often
I threw it into task scheduler instead
